"""Configfiles (_init.py)= this are properties that are used to externalize the data which is configurable (elimination of hard coded files) and if u put that data in ur code (test script) you have to build the code each time you want to change the value of the property (allow the selection of various features and setting) A config file is simply a file that holds config data. Test automation can read it in when test are launched and use the input values to control the test e.g
the config file culd specify the browser type to be used by the browser fixture from our project."""
